key decisions:
- used EIA-930 as spine initially in module 1 instead of more granular county level datasets (ISO/RTO native datasets) for simplicity
	- future improvements: incorporate more granular datasets
- Module 1: Built a reproducible ingestion pipeline using EIA-930 consolidated operational data, with region-scoped analysis driven by configuration.
- Module 4: We apply unsupervised machine learning to discover recurring grid operating regimes directly from load and imbalance dynamics, without imposing fragility labels. This allows us to test whether high-fragility states emerge naturally from the data rather than being artifacts of metric design.

key inferences:
- module 2: System-level demand magnitudes align with known operating ranges for PJM (~100–140 GW typical) and CAISO (~25–35 GW typical), providing an internal sanity check on feature correctness.

key notes:
- need to understand the variables better (ramps, z-scores)
- need to understand labels, features and metadata better from module 4 (ML terms)
- need to understand explained variance better module 4
- understand the pca process better from module 4

to-dos:
- fix the normalization for the caiso data because the 15 std outlier is what it's normalizing to and that's throwing it all off
o clean up the unsupervised ML figures
o figure out how to adjust k and whether to do HDBSCAN when more data is added and more regimes are created in the future
o A single schematic figure: Regime → Stress → Fragility → Recovery loop
o simplify the following module 5 overview below:
- Identified distinct operational regimes using unsupervised clustering on load and ramp features
- Demonstrated that fragility varies systematically by regime
- Showed that extreme fragility arises via multiple pathways: shocks, regime persistence, and stress accumulation
- Validated fragility metric as capturing dynamics not visible in raw ramp or load alone
